From Chapter 3 of "The Music Theory Handbook" - Marjorie Merryman

p33
-() melody, esp. outer voices (but more skips in bass p34)
- std : root doubled (root != bass)
- no more than one octave between soprano and alto, and between alto and tenor
-() better less space between the three upper voices, more between tenor and bass

p34s
- no paralell octaves, fifths and unissons
- () no direct octave and fifth, except if from skip in lowest, from step in upper
- avoid in melody augmented and diminished intervals (except in bass)
- () common tone voice leading

p35

- () V-VI : double third of VI
- VI-V minor : double third of VI

p36-37
- () predom in the end only after V-I
Score : (Ton + Predom)? (Dom Ton Predom?)* Dom TonS (Predom TonS)?
TonS : I
Ton : I + VI % pref I
Dom : V + VII + V7+ % pref V
Predom : II + IV % pref IV

p38

%see more here about doubling
- Lead (la sensible) : never doubled in V or VII

p39-40

- Ton += I6
- I6 : no doubling of third
- Predom += II6
- () II6 - V : II6 doubles third
- II6 otherwise : doubles third or root
- III6 minor : any doubling ok, major : perhaps not use
- IV6 : ok between V and V6
- V6 : only goes to I, doubles root or fifth
- VI6 : perhaps not uses
- VII6 : between I and I6, not double root (Leading tone)

p41 : non harmonic tones : see later perhaps

p43-44-45

Dom += I64 but only before V
- I64 : double the fifth
- other 64 uses : perhaps see later

p46 

- V7+ - Ton: Lead -> Tonic

p until end :  seven's chords, 60 Napolitan sixth, ... so less important
